/*
 Paths with Sum
 You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need tos tart or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).
