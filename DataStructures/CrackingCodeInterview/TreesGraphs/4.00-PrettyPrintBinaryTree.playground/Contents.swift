 Pretty Print a Binary Tree

 Concerns:
 - Padding the printing from the left edge
 - What do you do about large numbers with 2, 3 and 4 characters? Consider the character count for a given number.
 - How do you calculate the back slash/forward slash placements?
 - How wide do the slash-levels need to be to accomodate all the sub-trees?
 
 - Given a tree with N nodes, how many characters wide should each level K be? This will probably be constant for each level K.
 - A binary tree w/ K levels will have at most 2^K + 1 nodes.
