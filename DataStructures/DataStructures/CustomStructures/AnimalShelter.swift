 Animal Shelter:
 
 - An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly "first in, first out" basis.
 - People must adopt _either_ the "oldest" (based on arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, _or_ they can select whether they would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type).
 - They cannot select which specific animal they would like.
 
 TO DO:
 Create the data structures to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeueAny, dequeueDog, and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
 
 Concerns:
 - How do you define arrival time? (Does that even matter? If so, what use-case am I not
 - Need to know how long each dog/cat has been at the shelter. Can be called local age or logical age. For now can we just use a Queue and dequeue/enqueue? That can't be that easy.
 - To properly test this we need to prime the structure w/ data for dogs/cats
 - Do you make logical ages large numbers or small?
 - Can two animals arrive at exactly the same local age? If so, how do you resolve a collision, there?
 - What if we have two equally and locally aged cats and dogs and someone calls dequeueAny? Which do we choose?
 
 Approach 1:
 - Keep two queues 1 for dogs, 1 for cats. This makes the oldest animals the first to be released.
 - Oldest cast and oldest dog will always be the first to be dequeued.
